# STATE.md — goh current state

Where the project is right now. Read after `CLAUDE.md` at the start of every
session; update at the start of every PR and at the end of every session.

## Current state

- **Branch:** `chore/formula-validation`
- **Last merged:** PR #22 — Spotlight tagging and sleep assertions — `main` at
  `5b3884d`; PR #23 — one-shot CLI commands — `main` at `db9b82a`; PR #24 —
  CLI add options and JSON list — `main` at `58c2e73`; PR #25 — progress
  subscription contract — `main` at `c31283d`; PR #26 — backend progress
  subscription plumbing — `main` at `976775f`; PR #27 — foreground progress
  CLI — `main` at `076bfaf`; PR #28 — top progress dashboard — `main` at
  `0adf0a7`; PR #29 — release-packaging surface refresh — `main` at
  `2e1c3c7`.
- **Current slice:** Slice 9, Homebrew formula, signing, notarization, and the
  release pipeline. The first branch shipped the formula/README truth refresh in
  PR #29. The current branch adds CI validation for the in-repo Homebrew formula
  so packaging drift is caught on every PR before the heavier credential-backed
  signing and notarization workflow lands.
- **Slice 7 progress:** the first CLI implementation pass adds a testable
  `GohCore` command-line runner for the one-shot control verbs: `goh add`,
  `goh ls`, `goh pause`, `goh resume`, and `goh rm [--keep]`. `Sources/goh`
  is now thin process I/O plus the real XPC sender, and the existing
  `goh auth import safari` flow is routed through the same runner. The CLI
  returns `64` for local usage errors, `1` for daemon/transport failures, and
  prints `brew services start goh` guidance when the daemon is unreachable.
  Foreground `goh <url>` shipped in PR #27 as a live subscriber over the progress
  subscription path rather than a background-add alias.
  The follow-up CLI polish branch exposes already-frozen `add` options
  (`--output`, `--connections`, `--priority`, `--no-cookies`) and adds
  `goh ls --json` over the existing `LsReply` payload. PR #25 froze the
  load-bearing progress subscription contract: `Command.subscribe`,
  `SubscribeReply`, `ProgressEvent`, full in-scope progress snapshots,
  progress-model revisions, explicit `fullSnapshot` update events, 100 ms
  coalescing, foreground reconnect, and `goh top` subscription behavior. The
  PR #26 shipped the v3 wire schema, golden fixtures, protocol-version bump,
  session-aware XPC transport wrappers, broker-backed `subscribe` replies and
  notifications, `JobStore` progress publishing, and daemon composition through
  `ProgressBrokerHub`. PR #27 implemented foreground `goh <url>` as `add` plus
  `subscribe(scope: job, jobID:)` on one session. PR #28 shipped the first
  `goh top` dashboard over `subscribe(scope: all)`.
- **Slice 5 progress:** the first implementation step adds a pure in-memory
  `GohCore` Safari `Cookies.binarycookies` parser with Swift Testing coverage
  for page tables, offset-based strings, flags, Cocoa dates, and malformed
  inputs. The second step adds in-memory RFC 6265-style URL matching and
  `Cookie` header serialization with conservative host-only handling for bare
  Safari domains. The third step adds a download-engine cookie-header provider
  hook so initial, range-parallel, and resume requests can carry daemon-supplied
  cookies. The fourth step wires the frozen `add.useImportedCookies` field to a
  volatile per-job header snapshot and clears it on `rm`. No persistent
  cookie-store format or new IPC command has been added. The fifth step adds the
  Safari cookie-file locator for the modern container path plus legacy fallback.
  The sixth step composes one daemon-local `ImportedCookieStore` into both the
  dispatcher and `DownloadEngine`, so the already-built hooks are live in
  `gohd` without adding a new command. PR #19 shipped these non-wire
  foundations. PR #20 froze the load-bearing command/FDA contract for the
  remaining `goh auth import safari` surface. PR #21 implemented the
  `protocolVersion = 2` command, including XPC fd passing, daemon parse/import,
  and CLI Full Disk Access handling. PR #22 shipped Spotlight completion
  metadata and active-download sleep assertions. Slices 5 and 6 are shipped.
- **Last merged before #16:** PR #15 — core correctness gates — `dcdf709`.
- **Repository is public** (github.com/xaedyn/goh) — flipped 2026-05-22, which
  also made GitHub Actions free on the `macos-26` runner.

## Slice 3a — shipped (the milestone: `goh` moves bytes to disk)

- Engine job-store transitions — `start` (an atomic claim) / `recordProgress` /
  `complete` / `fail`, driving `queued → active → completed/failed`.
- `DownloadFile` — `pwrite` at offset, streaming SHA-256, the 1 MiB fsync
  checkpoint, best-effort `F_PREALLOCATE`.
- `DownloadEngine` — single-connection HTTP fetch over `URLSession`.
- Daemon wiring — `gohd` runs the engine on `add`, on `resume`, and for jobs
  still queued at startup.
- 84 tests; the engine path is tested over a `URLProtocol` mock.

## Slice 3b — range-parallel orchestration (shipped)

Built, tested (101 tests), pushed:

- `DownloadFile` reworked to pure positioned I/O (`pwrite`/`pread`, `Sendable`).
- `ChunkAssembler` — in-order hashing of out-of-order bytes via the
  contiguous-frontier read-back; single-connection runs through it as `N = 1`.
- `ByteRange.split` — file splitting capped by a minimum chunk size.
- The `HEAD` capability probe, `fetchRanged` with N writers in a `TaskGroup`,
  per-range failure cancelling siblings, the single-connection fallback,
  `actualConnectionCount` recorded and kept on completion.
- A default `User-Agent` — `goh/0.1 (+repo)` — on every download request, set
  via `GohCore.downloadSessionConfiguration()`.
- The `Benchmarks/` suite — `goh-bench` driver, `competitive.sh`, the hashing
  benchmark wired into CI. Default workloads rotated to Range-honoring URLs
  (amenable → an archive.org item; saturated → a `dl.google.com` asset, the
  synthetic Cloudflare endpoint having 403'd on `Range`). Each workload
  self-checks its structural assumption at run time — the amenability WARN
  joined by a saturation WARN.
- Engine diagnostics — `Benchmarks/diagnose.sh` plus `GOH_ENGINE_TRACE=1` emit
  per-range start / first-byte / completion timestamps, peak concurrent range
  count, and per-range critical-section time split between the `pwrite`+fsync
  phase and the assembler/progress/store mutex phase. Off in normal runs;
  release builds flip it on without recompiling.

Merged as PR #14. The final validated run accepted parity-for-v0.1 and moved the
remaining adaptive host scheduling work to v0.2.

## Roadmap from here

- **3c** — shipped in PR #17: checkpoint/resume implementation, error / retry /
  cancellation, live `pause` / `resume`, and `rm --keep` partial adoption.
- **4** — shipped in PR #18: `NWPathMonitor` cellular auto-pause (§12).
- **5** — shipped across PR #19, PR #20, and PR #21: Safari cookie import
  foundation, auth import command contract, and implementation.
- **6** — shipped in PR #22: Spotlight tagging and sleep assertions.
- **7** — shipped across PR #23, PR #24, and PR #27: the `goh` CLI client.
- **8** — shipped in PR #28: the TUI for `goh top`.
- **9** — in progress: Homebrew formula, signing, notarization, the release pipeline.
  PR #29 refreshed the pre-release formula/docs surfaces. The current branch adds
  formula validation to CI.

## Recent 3b validation notes

- **3b validated — parity-for-v0.1 accepted.** See the validated-measurement
  comment on PR #14 for the full numbers and reasoning. Saturated criterion
  met with margin (`goh` 7.020s vs `aria2c` 7.293s vs `curl` 6.802s at the
  default 8 conn — slight win over `aria2c`, 3.2 % behind `curl`'s
  single-stream ceiling). Amenable parity confirmed (`goh` 10.915s vs
  `aria2c` 10.958s at 8 conn; 16-conn data point widens `aria2c`'s lead
  marginally — the gap is the structural HTTP/2-vs-N-TCP one we've been
  circling, not a `goh` code defect).

  The investigation that got here surfaced and resolved three URLSession
  behaviours, of which the first two are quirks documented in DESIGN.md
  §Transport (*URLSession quirks*):

  **#1 — HEAD's `expectedContentLength = -1`.** `URLSession` does not
  populate `expectedContentLength` from `Content-Length` for `HEAD`
  responses on the wire, even when the server sent the header. The probe's
  `expectedContentLength > 0` check therefore always failed and the engine
  always fell back to single-connection. **The range-parallel orchestration
  shipped in 3a/3b had never actually run on the wire** — `MockURLProtocol`
  builds its response from `headerFields:` and populates
  `expectedContentLength`, hiding the quirk in CI. Fixed by parsing
  `Content-Length` from the response header directly.

  **#2 — auto-decompression breaks ranged downloads.** `URLSession`'s
  default `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br` triggers transparent
  content-decoding. A `Range` over an encoded body returns a partial slice
  of the *encoded* stream, which the decoder can't start mid-stream for
  ranges past 0 (-1015) and over-decodes range 0 (proportional overshoot).
  Verified by isolating in a 4-variant Swift test program against the
  saturated host: the original HTTP/2-multiplexing hypothesis was falsified.
  Fixed by sending `Accept-Encoding: identity`.

  **#3 (engine hygiene) — byte-by-byte AsyncBytes replaced with chunked
  Data delivery.** `URLSession.bytes(for:)` was iterating one async
  suspension per byte (~70M per range on the amenable file). Replaced with
  a `URLSession.dataTask` + `URLSessionDataDelegate` bridge that yields
  `Data` chunks via an `AsyncThrowingStream`. Tested as the amenable-gap
  hypothesis; **falsified** — the asymmetric throughput pattern reproduces
  locally with the new chunked code at the same magnitude. The change
  ships anyway as engine hygiene (~70M async iterations per range becomes
  ~700-760).

  **Competitive re-run (post #1 + #2):**
  - **Saturated PARITY achieved.** `goh` 7.056s vs `aria2c` 7.300s vs `curl`
    6.223s. Saturation check PASS (`aria2c 0.85× curl`, converged). `goh`
    slightly faster than `aria2c`; both pay ~13-17% overhead vs single-conn
    `curl` — the intrinsic cost of parallelism. The slice's hardest target
    is met.
  - **Amenable check WARN'd as expected** (curl 0.3s cached at edge), and
    inside the WARN `goh` is ~5× slower than `aria2c` on the same ranged
    URL (164s vs 33s). The diagnostic trace shows asymmetric throughput
    (1-2 ranges fast, 6-7 throttled to ~430 KB/s) that reproduces locally
    against archive.org. Not a goh code issue — the leading hypothesis is
    archive.org's per-stream rate-limiting under sustained HTTP/2 multiplexed
    load, against which `aria2c`'s HTTP/1.1 + separate-TCP-connection model
    fares better. `URLSession` doesn't expose a clean way to force HTTP/1.1.

  Three of the four original diagnostic hypotheses are now ruled out:
  cap-throttling (cap is 16, observed peak=8); mutex contention
  (`writeMs`+`reportMs` per range stay single-digit milliseconds); and
  AsyncBytes byte-iteration (chunked Data fix didn't change the gap).

  **HTTP/3 trial reverted.** A first round of three optimizations
  (speculative ranged GET, per-request `URLRequest.assumesHTTP3Capable`,
  1 MiB flush buffer) regressed the saturated workload by ~45 %
  (`goh` 6.607s → 10.754s median, with run-to-run variance suggesting
  server-side rate-limiting against h3 traffic on this network path).
  `aria2c` and `curl` stayed flat. HTTP/3 reverted; skip-HEAD and 1 MiB
  buffer kept (they don't show the variance signature). The slice landed
  a per-range `protocol=` trace line so the next h3 attempt isn't blind.

  **Final state at merge:** speculative ranged GET (one RTT saved per
  download), 1 MiB flush buffer (~16× fewer pwrites), per-range protocol
  diagnostic, all URLSession quirks (HEAD `expectedContentLength = -1`
  and Range-incompatible auto-decompression) worked around, two committed
  default benchmark workloads with run-time amenability/saturation checks,
  the engine diagnostics that drove this slice's debugging cycles. 101
  tests; CI green.

## Next-session handoff

Current branch: `chore/formula-validation`.

PR #29 passed CI and was squash-merged into `main` at `2e1c3c7`. It made the
pre-release Homebrew formula and README match the implemented CLI/TUI: the
formula now has a `head` stanza and a current `goh --help` smoke test, and the
README no longer claims the CLI commands are placeholders.

This branch continues Slice 9 by adding a `Validate Homebrew formula` step to
CI. The step runs:

- `ruby -c Formula/goh.rb`
- `brew style Formula/goh.rb`

Local gates before PR:

- `ruby -c Formula/goh.rb`
- `brew style Formula/goh.rb`
- `git diff --check`
- `swift build -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`
- `swift test` — 207 tests
- `swift run -c release goh-bench hash-overhead 256` — inline 0.1937s, unified
  0.1932s, overhead -0.2 %
- `swift run goh --help`

Next pickup: push and open the formula-validation PR, then merge it only if CI
and comments are clean.

Leave unrelated untracked files (`AGENTS.md`,
`Benchmarks/diagnose-saturated.log`) untouched.
